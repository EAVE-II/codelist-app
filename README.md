# Read code app

This repo contains code for an application that creates interactive tables of read codes and ICD-10 codes. You can search in multiple fields, and you can download csv files that contain the codes.

- "code_library.xlsx" - This file contains a collection of codes that are used by the application, and instructions on how to make additions. Inform Steven Kerr (steven.kerr@ed.ac.uk) if you make any changes and they will be published to the app.
- 01_app.R - This is the code for the application.
